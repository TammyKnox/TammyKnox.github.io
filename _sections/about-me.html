<p><strong>Hi, I'm Tammy. A Front End Developer who enljoys UI/UX design and digital marketing. In my spare time I like to work on improving my craft, but I also like to focus on my other passions. I enjoy learning foreign languages, such as Spanish and Japansese and my health is very important to me. I typically start my day off with weight lifting and jogging. My all time guilty pleasure is photography and I actively practice minimalism. So you can consider me a minimalist and indpendent creative.</p>
