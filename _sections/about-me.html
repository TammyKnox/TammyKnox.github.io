<p><strong>Hi, I'm Tammy. A Front End Developer who enloys UI/UX design and digital marketing. In my spare time I like to work on improving my craft but I also like to focus on my other passions. I enjoy learning foreign languages, such as Spanish and Japansese. Also, my health is important to me. So I typically start my day off with weight lifting and jogging.</p>
