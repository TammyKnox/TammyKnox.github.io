<p>Over the few years that I've been working as a developer, I've always practiced my craft and sought to improve my skills. This is just one reason why I enjoy solving various algorithm challenges. So, one day I had this idea to create a portfolio for my code. Now, in reality, Github is technically my code portfolio. But, I wanted to design one specifically for the algorithms I've worked on. So, I came up with the idea to create an algorithm <em>"codefolio"</em> in Angular.</p>

<p>In this series I'm going to walk you through the steps I took to create an algorithm "codefolio" in Angular. This series will be broken up into parts. In part one, we'll go over the different aspects of the  planning phase of a project. In part two, we'll briefly touch on how I came up with the design and then dive into building out the design in angular. You can view the design for the algorithm portfolio here.</p>

<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
<p>During this phase you would find out who your target audience is and what they would look for out of this particular thing we're building. My target audience is employers. Because I'm targeting employers specifically, I know that what will matter most is the code itself and the presentation is just icing on the cake. The design should be clean and focus on a flat design/card style. Now with my audience in mind, I know that not only does the code for the algorithms need to be top notch, but so does the code for the portfolio itself. This leads me to deeply consider the user stories, features, and user experience of what I'm building.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The user should be able to navigate to the algorithms challenge page and back to the home page with ease.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to easily find links to the authors social media profiles.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to see at least 9 algorithm challenges on the home page at first glance.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to sort through the algorithm challenges from that page with a tag or filter option.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to see the name of the challenge, a short description, and the technology used in the challenge at first glance on the card.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to click on a clearly defined "view more" button that will open up the card to reveal the algorithm and the solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    The solution should have the algorithm name as the heading, the description, and the solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to exit the solution and return the algorithm challenge main page.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should be able to share the solution on social media or copy the solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user should receive a message that says "copied to clipboard."
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Based off of the user stories and the creative brief, I know that I'm going to use the Materialize Framework and Angular for the app. We'll go into more details in the next post.</p>
